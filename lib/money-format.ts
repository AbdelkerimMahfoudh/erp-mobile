/**
 * Money and number formatting — the one place amounts become text.
 *
 * Split out of `lib/format.ts` so it depends on **nothing**: no React Native, no
 * i18n store, no date library. That is what lets `money-format.test.ts` run
 * under bare `node`, and it keeps a single formatter behind every screen,
 * button, card, receipt and export. `lib/format.ts` re-exports all of it, so
 * existing imports are unchanged and there is still only one implementation.
 *
 * Deliberately built WITHOUT `Intl`. Hermes ships inconsistent ICU coverage
 * across platforms, and `toLocaleString` with currency options can silently
 * ignore what you asked for. Money is the highest-stakes text in this app; a
 * price that renders differently on one employee's phone is a real-world
 * mistake. So grouping is done by hand, and behaves identically everywhere.
